# Coleman Integrated Solutions — GitHub Pages bundle

This is a ready-to-drop static bundle.

## What changed
- All occurrences of “clowdcover” → “Coleman Integrated Solutions”.
- Fixed root-relative asset paths (/css, /js, /images, etc.) to relative so they work under project URLs.
- GTM snippets commented out (enable later by replacing with your own ID).
- Added `assets/coleman-logo.png` and referenced it in the first detected logo image.
- Added `.nojekyll`.

## Deploy
1) Upload everything in this ZIP to your repo root (e.g., `jsquiggle/colemanintegrated.com`).  
2) Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main → /(root).  
3) Visit `https://jsquiggle.github.io/colemanintegrated.com/`.
