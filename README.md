# Coleman Integrated Solutions — Starter (with Pricing + Contact)

This is the clean starter with your logo, a Pricing page, and a Contact form pattern (Formspree).

## Deploy
1. Upload all files to your repo root (e.g., `jsquiggle/colemanintegrated.com`).
2. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main → /(root).
3. Visit `https://jsquiggle.github.io/colemanintegrated.com/`.

## Contact Form (Formspree)
- Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in `contact.html` with your Formspree form ID.
- Or switch to EmailJS if you prefer; I can wire it for you—just share your public key, service ID, and template ID.
